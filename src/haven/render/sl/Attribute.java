    /* Ths "primary" thing is mostly just OCD. There apparently do
     * exist some old (buggy, I can only presume) drivers, Intel
     * observed (with OpenGL 3.1) that require a "position-like"
     * attribute in location 0. The error message from the driver when
     * such is not the case makes it kind of obvious that it's
     * probably buggy:
     *   "A matrix is bound to generic attribute 0. Position can not be a matrix."
     * -So is it "generic" or "position"? one might ask.
     * -Not really my problem. one might also conclude.
     *
     * That being said, the vertex position being in the first
     * location also makes programs like RenderDoc able to autodetect
     * the position, so I don't utterly hate having this anyway.
